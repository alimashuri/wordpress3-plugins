Requires at least: 2.7
Tested up to: 3.0
Stable tag: 3.2.3.1
Adds an attractive social bookmarking menu to your posts, pages, index, or any combination of the three.


== Description ==
Though the name may be a little "edgy" for some, SexyBookmarks has proven time and time again to be an extremely useful and successful tool in getting your readers to actually **submit your articles** to numerous social bookmarking sites. 

Our sole aim was to stray away from the "in the box" thinking behind most social bookmarking plugins, and add a little flair that would entice your readers, rather than deterring them with microscopic icons that get lost in pages heavy laden with content.


*** Now with Official Google Buzz Integration ***


= Recent Updates =
* Small bug fix for short URLs when cURL not enabled
* Removed Fleck as it no longer exists
* Removed "Load scripts in footer" from default settings
* Short URL function now uses wp http api
* Added urldecode() to bitly and supr JSON requests
* Removed fopen() from sprite request, now uses the WP http api



= Recently Added Sites =
* Yahoo! Mail
* Gmail
* Hotmail
* Buzzster!

= Manual Usage =
**As of v2.5 the menu can be inserted once anywhere within your site (even outside the loop) and it will still pull the appropriate data for the dynamic links**

If you would like to insert the menu manually, simply choose "Manual Mode" from the options page, then place the following code into your theme files where you want the menu to appear:

`<?php if(function_exists('selfserv_sexy')) { selfserv_sexy(); } ?>`

You can still configure the other options available when inserting manually and they will be passed to the function. This is for those of you who have requested to be able to place the menu anywhere you choose... Enjoy!
