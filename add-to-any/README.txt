Help people share, bookmark, and email your posts & pages using any service, such as Facebook, Twitter, Google Buzz, Digg and many more.

== Description ==

The most complete plugin to help people **share**, **bookmark**, and **email** your posts and pages using **any service**, such as Facebook, Twitter, Google Buzz, Digg, Delicious, and well over 100 more social bookmarking and sharing sites. The button comes with AddToAny's customizable **Smart Menu**, which **places the services visitors use at the top of the menu**, based on each visitor's browsing and usage history.

<a href="http://www.addtoany.com/" title="Sharing and bookmarking button widget" target="_blank">Share Button</a> (demo)

The E-mail tab makes it easy to share via Google Gmail, Yahoo! Mail, Hotmail, AOL, and any other web-based e-mailer or desktop program. The **Add to Favorites** button (or Bookmark tab) helps users bookmark using any browser (Internet Explorer, Firefox, Chrome, Safari, Opera, etc.).

Individual **service icons** let you optimize your blog posts for specific social sites.  Choose from over 100 individual services.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Where are the options? =

In your Admin panel, go to `Settings` > `Share/Save Buttons`.  Among other options, you can choose which button and individual icons to display, and where and how to display them. 

= Why isn't the drop-down menu appearing? =

It's likely because your theme wasn't <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Theme_Development#Plugin_API_Hooks" target="_blank">coded properly</a>.  Using the Theme Editor, make sure that the following piece of code is included in your theme's `footer.php` file just before the `</body>` line:

`<?php wp_footer(); ?>`

= How can I add both the button and the individual icons to another area of my theme? =

In the Theme Editor, place this code block where you want the button and individual icons to appear in your theme:

`<?php if( function_exists('ADDTOANY_SHARE_SAVE_KIT') ) { ADDTOANY_SHARE_SAVE_KIT(); } ?>`

If you want to customize the shared URL and title for the button and standalone services, use the following code as a template:

`<?php if( function_exists('ADDTOANY_SHARE_SAVE_KIT') ) { 
	ADDTOANY_SHARE_SAVE_KIT( array("linkname" => "Example Page", "linkurl" => "http://example.com/page.html") );
} ?>`

= How can I add just the button to another area of my theme? =

In the Theme Editor, you will place this line of code where you want the button to appear in your theme:

`<?php if( function_exists('ADDTOANY_SHARE_SAVE_BUTTON') ) { ADDTOANY_SHARE_SAVE_BUTTON(); } ?>`

If you want to customize the shared URL and title for this button, use the following code as a template:

`<?php if( function_exists('ADDTOANY_SHARE_SAVE_BUTTON') ) { 
	ADDTOANY_SHARE_SAVE_BUTTON( array("linkname" => "Example Page", "linkurl" => "http://example.com/page.html") );
} ?>`

= How can I add just the individual icons to another area of my theme? =

In the Theme Editor, place this line of code where you want the individual icons to appear in your theme (within an HTML list):

`<?php echo '<ul class="addtoany_list">';
if( function_exists('ADDTOANY_SHARE_SAVE_ICONS') )
	ADDTOANY_SHARE_SAVE_ICONS( array("html_wrap_open" => "<li>", "html_wrap_close" => "</li>") );
echo '</ul>'; ?>`

If you want to customize the shared URL and title for these icons, use the following code as a template:

`<?php
if( function_exists('ADDTOANY_SHARE_SAVE_ICONS') ) {
	echo '<ul class="addtoany_list">';
	ADDTOANY_SHARE_SAVE_ICONS( array(
		"html_wrap_open" => "<li>", "html_wrap_close" => "</li>",
		"linkname" => "Example Page", "linkurl" => "http://example.com/page.html"
	));
	echo '</ul>';
} ?>`

Or you can place the icons as individual links (without being wrapped in an HTML list):

`<?php if( function_exists('ADDTOANY_SHARE_SAVE_ICONS') ) { ADDTOANY_SHARE_SAVE_ICONS(); } ?>`

If you want to customize the shared URL and title for these icons, use the following code as a template:

`<?php if( function_exists('ADDTOANY_SHARE_SAVE_ICONS') ) {
	ADDTOANY_SHARE_SAVE_ICONS( array("linkname" => "Example Page", "linkurl" => "http://example.com/page.html") );
} ?>`

= How can I add a new custom standalone service? =
You can create a plugin or customize the following PHP sample code to add to your theme's function.php file:

`function addtoany_add_services( $services ) {
  $services['google_example'] = array(
    'name' => 'Google Example',
    'icon_url' => 'http://www.google.com/favicon.ico',
	'icon_width' => 16,
	'icon_height' => 16,
    'href' => 'http://www.example.com/add?linkurl=A2A_LINKURL&amp;linkname=A2A_LINKNAME'
  );
  return $services;
}
add_filter('A2A_SHARE_SAVE_services', 'addtoany_add_services', 10, 1);`

= How can I align the button and/or icons to the center or to the right side of posts? =
It depends on your theme, but you can try adding the following CSS code to your main stylesheet.

To align right:
`.addtoany_share_save_container { text-align:right; }`

To align center:
`.addtoany_share_save_container { text-align:center; }`

= How can I remove a button from individual posts and pages? =

Insert the following tag into the page or post (HTML tab) that you do not want the button to appear in: `<!--nosharesave-->`

= How can I force the button to appear in individual posts and pages? =

If your button isn't already set up to appear (it is by default), insert the following tag into the page or post (HTML tab) that you want the button to appear in: `<!--sharesave-->`

= Why doesn't Facebook use the page title and how can I set the image Facebook uses? =

Facebook does link sharing a little differently than most other services. Facebook will sometimes use the Meta Description of a shared page instead of the page's title or the title you have set for AddToAny.

To change the title, description and/or image on Facebook, you will need to modify your theme header file according to <a href="http://wiki.developers.facebook.com/index.php/Facebook_Share/Specifying_Meta_Tags">Facebook's specification</a>. With WordPress, this can be accomplished with plugins like the <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/all-in-one-seo-pack/">All in One SEO Pack plugin</a>.  Please see that plugin to for details, and post in the WordPress or plugin author's forums for more support.

= Does the plugin output W3C valid code? =

Yes, AddToAny outputs 100% W3C valid XHTML and W3C valid CSS 3.0.

If you move the plugin's CSS code to your theme's stylesheet, note that one proprietary vendor prefix (`filter`) is used.  It's utilized for cross-browser compatibility with Internet Explorer.  For more information about the W3C CSS Validator and the `filter` property, see <a href="http://www.websitedev.de/css/validator-faq#extensions">Why don't my scrollbar properties, filters, etc. validate?</a>  If you feel compelled, you can move the line into an Internet Explorer-only stylesheet, or remove the line at the cost of the opacity hover effect in Internet Explorer.

= How can I move the plugin's inline CSS into my theme's main external stylesheet? =

Go to `Settings` > `Share/Save Buttons` > uncheck `Use inline CSS` and place the CSS code in your theme's main stylesheet.

= Why do embedded objects (like Flash) disappear when the menu is displayed? =

This is done to overcome browser limitations that prevent the drop-down menu from displaying on top of intersecting embedded objects.  If you would like to disable this, uncheck the `Hide embedded objects (Flash, video, etc.) that intersect with the menu when displayed` option on the plugin's settings page.
